# Workflow Builder

Build and optimize workflows for AI agents and automation tasks.

## Description

A comprehensive skill for designing, implementing, and optimizing workflows. Helps create efficient process flows, identify bottlenecks, and suggest improvements.

## Features

- **Flow Design** - Create efficient workflow structures
- **Automation** - Identify tasks suitable for automation
- **Optimization** - Find and eliminate bottlenecks
- **Documentation** - Document workflows clearly

## Common Workflow Patterns

### Sequential Flow
```
Task A → Task B → Task C
```

### Parallel Flow
```
    → Task B →
Task A             Task D
    → Task C →
```

### Conditional Flow
```
Task A → [Condition] → Yes/No
           ↓         ↓
       Task B    Task C
```

## Use Cases

- Automate repetitive tasks
- Build AI agent workflows
- Design data pipelines
- Create approval processes

## Example Workflows

### Content Publishing Workflow
```
Research → Write → Review → Edit → Publish → Monitor
```

### Customer Support Workflow
```
Receive → Classify → Auto-Reply → Escalate → Resolve → Follow-up
```

## Best Practices

1. **Keep it simple** - Start with minimal steps
2. **Add checkpoints** - Review points for quality
3. **Handle errors** - Plan for failure scenarios
4. **Document decisions** - Why this flow?
5. **Iterate** - Improve based on feedback
